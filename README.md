# Rock vs Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project uses Logistic Regression to classify sonar signal data as either a **Rock** or a **Mine**. The dataset is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks)) and contains sonar signals reflected from metal cylinders (mines) and rocks under the sea.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- **Goal**: Predict whether an object is a rock or mine using sonar frequency data.
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

📊 Dataset Overview
208 samples

60 features per sample (numerical values)

Binary label: M for Mine, R for Rock

📈 Model Performance
Evaluated using accuracy score, confusion matrix, precision, and recall.

Accuracy typically ranges around 83–86% based on train-test split.

🧠 Logistic Regression
A basic yet powerful classification algorithm suitable for binary classification tasks like this. It estimates probabilities using a logistic (sigmoid) function.
